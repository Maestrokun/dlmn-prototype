            <h3><img src="">Features</h3>
            <h4>24/7 Access to content</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">With learning no longer confined to the classroom, this LMS allows learners online access to learning materials from anywhere in the world, and when it’s most convenient.</p>

            <h4><img src="">Staff Management</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">With an ever increasing competition and compliance requirements, administrators can use the LMS to gauge teacher-student engagement, learning materials delivered and the rate of online adoption.</p>

            <h4><img src="">Student Assessment</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">Being an integral part of the conventional learning model, continuous assessments can be planned, published, scored and tracked on the go both as part of curriculum and as a test of student’s learning experience.</p>

            <h4><img src="">Communication</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">Nothing good ever gets done without proper communication. How do you communicate when there is too much to be communicated with too many people?</p>

            <h4><img src="">Information on the go</h4>
            <p class="paragraph">With the sheer volume of information out there, are your students, staff and management able to access the right information at the right time? How accessible are your current information systems?</p>

            <h4>Mobile ready</h4>
            <p>With mobile application usage surging in recent years, a system must take into account the convenience and flexibility offered by mobile devices. For this reason our learning management platform accommodates mobile users so that they use the system on the go offering a superior user experience.</p>
            <img src="">
            <h4>Virtual classrooms</h4>
            <p>A virtual classroom environment ensures human connection, a vital element of classroom teaching that video-on-demand courses don’t have and sorely miss. In a virtual classroom, teachers interact with students in real time; students can voice their questions and interact with peers similar to how they would in a regular classroom, albeit over the internet. An additional perk of virtual classrooms is that they are scalable to accommodate a larger number of students. Physical classrooms often limit seating to a maximum number so that students can sit comfortably and have enough space to themselves.</p>
            <img src="">
            <h4>E-Library</h4>
            <p>E-library services are an essential component of a quality e-learning system. As access to internet-based courses grows, an increasing number of e-learners are dispersed around the globe, often in parts of the world where physical access to the collections of large academic and research libraries is impossible. There is undoubtedly a keenness to use online information resources for research and teaching. E-library supports e-learning courses with a bundle of networked e-information services such as development of course-related electronic collections, textbooks, journals, virtual reference help, current awareness and SDI, online document delivery, etc</p>
